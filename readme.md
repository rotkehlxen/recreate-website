# Recreate example web page from Brad Schiff

I took the udemy course [Web Design for Beginners: Real World Coding in HTML & CSS](https://www.udemy.com/course/web-design-for-beginners-real-world-coding-in-html-css/) from [Brad Schiff](http://www.schiffwebdesign.com/).

At the end of the course he is providing an example web page that is built
using twitter bootstrap. I am trying to rebuild the page **without
bootstrap** to teach myself advanced concepts in CSS.

Current status [here](https://rotkehlxen.github.io/recreate-website/).
